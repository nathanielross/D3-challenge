          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h3>
          <p>There is a positive correlation between risk factors obesity and smoking in relation to poverty and household income. 
              A visible trend shows that poorer states have higher obesity rates and greater rates of smoking. 
              There was a higher rate of healthcare coverage in wealther states, but lower obesity and smoking rates.
              However, there are some outliers; states such as North Dakota and Iowa have relatively low poverty and high obesity rates.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age</h3>
          <p>The correlations between health risks and age are a little more difficult to see. The median age in most US states is between 
              36-40 years old. This made the visualizations a little more cluster which makes it more difficult to identify correlations. However,there are some correlations such as higher median age and higher healthcare
              coverage; lower median age and lower smoking rates; and lower median age and lower obesity rates.</p>
